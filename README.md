nodashtube
==========

web frontend on top of [youtube-dl] [2] for downloading/viewing vids.

Mainly useful if [dash] [1] behaves poorly on your connection, since apparently youtube does not offer the option to disable it. Or if you like to store the youtube vids but you're too lazy (like me) to use youtube-dl from the cli.

Install:
--------

 1. Install Go: http://golang.org/doc/install
 2. go get github.com/mpl/nodashtube
 3. (or ask me for a binary)
